## Summary

OrderTracker is a tool to help Staples Copy and Print center associates keep track of orders to prevent associates from overbooking orders. OrderTracker makes adding or completing orders quick and easy. It also allows associates share local OrderTracker data with other networked OrderTrackers to allow all OrderTrackers to be in sync. OrderTracker makes shifting orders down from the previous day's "Tomorrow's Orders" to the current day's "Today's Orders" easy by doing it for them if requested to do so. OrderTracker will improve Copy and Print center's organizational capabilities greatly, allowing no time to be overbooked keeping both associates and customers happy.
